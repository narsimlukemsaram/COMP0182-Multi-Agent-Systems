# COMP0182 (Multi-Agent Systems): Lab Sheet 9

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 1: The multi-agent auto navigation simulation using two robots in the PyBullet simulator. The map used in this simulation will be the same as we will physically realize in the arena.

## Task 2: Navigation of the two robots at the same time using the waypoints based on the simulation output file. 

## Task 3: Apply the CBS algorithm to the calibrated waypoints and navigate the two robots autonomously simultaneously. [Optional] You can use any innovative algorithm, such as PBS, RRT*, etc.

## To-Do List

- [Task 1] Simulation of the multi-agent auto navigation using two robots in the PyBullet simulator.
- [Task 2] Navigation of the two robots at the same time using the waypoints based on the simulation output file.
- [Task 3] Applying the CBS algorithm on the calibrated waypoints.

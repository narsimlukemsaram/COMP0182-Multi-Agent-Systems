## Final Student Challenge

A maze navigation in real-world arena with two TurtleBots. 

# Steps

- [Step 1] We will define a fixed maze structure with the corresponding start1/start2 and goal1/goal2 positions for the robots in the maze. 
- [Step 2] Student must implement the maze structure in the PyBullet simulation and run the multi-agent auto navigation using two TurtleBots with CBS/PBS/RRT* (or student innovative algorithm) alogorithm and save the resulting navigation trajectory to a file.
- [Step 3] Run the same multi-agent navigation of the two robots at the same time using the waypoints based on the saved trajectory file in real-world arena.
